# CamIdentify

- This app opens your webcam through your computer & starts scanning that's being shown for EX: it will scan you & see you as a 'Person', if you show a controller it will output it as a 'Remote' and if you have a tie on it will scan it and say its a 'Tie'. 

- [UPDATE] currently the logic on this is a little bland, I think I will have to implement an AI in the script so it may identify correct items. Recently it was marking a USB as a phone?, & when showing a Gateway it will mark it as a cup? (depending on what you have ofc). but that's the case with this script... this needs to be implemented & will update soon in V2.
